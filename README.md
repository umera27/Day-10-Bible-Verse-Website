Project Title : Bible Verse 

The idea is simple: when you want to read about a specific topic, like happiness, 
it will provide relevant Bible verses and topics related to that theme.
I haven’t added all the Bible content yet,
but it’s been a cool experience so far—definitely worth a try!

I’ve organized the Bible verses into a JSON file to make retrieval simpler.
Plus, I added a feature to change the background color, which adds a nice touch. 
Check it out!
